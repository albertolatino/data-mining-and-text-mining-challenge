# data-mining-and-text-mining-challenge

*Data Mining and Text Mining* is course offered at Politecnico di Milano.
In this repository you can find the outputs that we created for the competition in the academic year (2020/2021).

Notebooks must be executed from 1-Preprocessing to 6-Predictions in order.
Every notebook generates a new .csv file that will be loaded in the next one.
Every .csv file is saved in a folder called data so that we could use relative paths.
